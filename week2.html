<h4>1. The canyons and geysers in Yellowstone National Park</h4>
<p>Most people know Yellowstone has geysers, but what really pleasantly surprised me is how much diversity there is in the park. In addition to the must-see geysers that can feel a little crowded, there is an amazing canyon. While the canyon is not as big as the grand canyon, it is certainly impressive. Also, we got to see a lot of Bison up close.</p>
<br>
<h4>2. Traveling with one of my best friends</h4>
<p>We've known each other for 29 years and we finally found some time to do a long trip! Very happy we were able to do this road trip together and that we were able to build a lot of great memories.</p>
<br>
<h4>3. Camping in amazing places</h4>
<p>So we brought a tent. We thought we may not even use it, but we surprised ourselves by camping for a third of the nights! Yes, the tent was a bit small, but it allowed us to stay close to nature instead of in a faraway motel so that made for a really good base to explore all the national parks</p>
<br>
<h4>4. Experiencing Vancouver with our own local guide</h4>
<p>In Vancouver we visited Janna's uncle which gave us an excellent opportunity to experience the city with some great help from a local. We went on a boat ride in the river and out to sea, saw a local farm and had the best burger on our trip.</p>
<br>
<h4>5. Not being eaten by a bear in Glacier national park</h4>
<p>So Glacier National Park is a bit tricky. It's beautiful, but there are Grizzly bears. The solution? When out hiking, clap and shout out every few minutes to let the bears know you are there. As a result we didn't see any bears. This is both a good thing (you do not get eaten) and a bad thing (would've been nice to at least see one from the safety of the car). In order to illustrate how serious they are about bears: you have to carry bear-spray which is a kind of pepper spray (but much stronger and it reaches 10 meters) that you can use as a last resort in case you get attacked. Also, you need to hang your food in a tree so the bears cannot reach it.</p>
<p>So we decided this would be the ideal spot to go hiking for three days with all our gear and the tent, which indeed turned out to be an excellent choice because both the weather and the scenery were amazing.</p>
<p>So we didn't see bears, but we saw Moose. Moose are big (like a horse) and have Antlers (like.. I don't know, but big!). And while it was amazing to see the Moose, things got a little scary when they walked (or ran) in and around our campsite in the evening. We had to take a little bit of cover behind the trees sometimes, because Moose can also kill you. In the end we decided to just go to bed, put earplugs in and hope for the best.(and if you're reading this, that worked)</p>
<br>
<h4>6. Losing with Roulette in Reno</h4>
<p>So we went to the casino's and we lost, but it was still fun. Reno is not as big as Vegas, but there are some entertaining casino's and since they are connected you can visit multiple casino's and never go outside. Another entertaining fact: the burning man festival had just ended and Reno is the closest city. All these burning man people ended up going to Reno because the hotels are pretty cheap and it's pretty close. At first we had no clue where all those dusty out of place people came from, but when we finally figured it out it made a lot of sense.</p>
<br>
<h4>7. The endless roads of Idaho</h4>
<p>So we saw a lot of roads, as makes sense because we did a roadtrip. There were a lot of different roads and they all had their beauty but some roads are special because they seem infinite.</p>
<br>
<h4>8. Figuring it all out last minute</h4>
<p>Part of the beauty of the trip was having no plan. Of course, we knew where we needed to go in the end to take a plane but we had the freedom to make the decisions on the same day and on the spot, which gave us a lot of freedom.</p>
<br>
<h4>9. Kayaking on <strike>Lake Louise </strike>Lake Tahoe</h4>
<p>A good example of a good idea at the last minute: we had a great afternoon on Lake Tahoe and did some real exercise in our kayak (not pictured)!</p>
<br>
<h4>10. Meeting friends, drinking Pisco, and visiting secret bars in San Francisco</h4>
<p>So we only had a day and a half in San Francisco. Of course, way too short but we managed to do a lot actually! We cycled the golden gate bridge, rode the ferry from Sausalito and visited the Alcatraz prison.</p>
<p>I was also able to catch up with two friends that are currently studying in Berkeley. On the first night we met with Isy and found our way into a hidden bar that you could only enter once you went through a wine shop and opened a secret bookshelf! On the second night we met up with Floor and ended up drinking cocktails and we had a great dinner at a Peruvian restaurant where they also had Pisco's!</p>
